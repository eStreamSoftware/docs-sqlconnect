# DDNS

Get a free DDNS from Duckdns if you don't have one.

:::info
The *free DDNS* might not be as reliable. If you are concerned about strict uptime, we recommend considering a **paid DDNS** such as noip, dyndns.
:::

## Steps

1. If you don't have a DDNS, you may get one free from **DuckDNS**.
2. Firstly, visit [Duck DNS](https://www.duckdns.org/).
