# Database

## Backup

> In the public cloud, clients do not need to worry about backup, as we have implemented comprehensive backup and disaster recovery policies to protect their data.

If you wish to download a database backup to you local PC, backup your data to **SQL Drive on SQL Connect > Download** folder. More info can be found in the [Download](./basic#download) section.

## Restore

### Public Cloud

For public cloud, restoration cannot be performed via the web browser. We have intentionally locked this feature to ensure the safety of user data. Please contact our support team with your database backup, and we will restore your database promptly.

### Private Cloud

For a private cloud, users can restore the database directly on their server, performing the restoration just as they would locally.
